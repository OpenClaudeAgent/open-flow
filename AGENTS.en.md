# Global Instructions

## Task Management

**REQUIRED**: For any non-trivial task (3+ steps), use the TodoWrite tool to:
1. Create the task list at the beginning
2. Mark each task `in_progress` when you start it
3. Mark each task `completed` as soon as it's done

The user must be able to follow your progress at any time.

## Exceptions

Do not use todos for:
- Simple questions / informative answers
- Trivial tasks (< 3 steps)
- Quick minor fixes
