# Reporting Template - Refactoring

When you complete Phase 3 (report to Executor), use this template:

## Report Refactoring-[N] (for Executor-[N])

### ✅ Results
- Refactorings applied : [list of patterns applied]
- Anti-patterns eliminated : [list]
- Commits : [number and summary]

### ⚠️ Problems
- Complex branching : [details if yes, "None" if no]
- Tests required : [list or "None"]

### 🔧 Actions Required
- Tests to write : [list if yes, "Tester will take over"]
- Manual validations : [list or "None"]

### 📌 Important Notes
[Key points, improvements made, limitations, recommendations for Tester]

**CRITICAL**: Include Notes integrally - they flow up to Executor.
