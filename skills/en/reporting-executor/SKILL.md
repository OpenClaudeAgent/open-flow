### ✅ Implementation
- Modified files : [list]
- Problems : [list or "None"]

### ✅ Refactoring (via Refactoring-[N])
[Include FULL report from Refactoring - with all its notes]

### ✅ Tests (via Tester-[N])
[Include FULL report from Tester - with all its notes]

### ✅ Quality (via Quality-[N])
[Include FULL report from Quality - with all its notes]

### ⚠️ Problems
[Consolidation of all problems or "None"]

### 🔧 Actions Required
[Consolidation of all actions or "None"]

### 📌 Consolidated Important Notes
[ALL notes from all agents - NEVER summarized, always integral]

**CRITICAL**: Never summarize Important Notes - include them in full.

### 🔧 Worktree Branch
- `worktrees/feature/[name]` → `feature/[name]`
